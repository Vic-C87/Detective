  - TheQuestion: 'I promise, tell me what you saw. '
    TheAnswer: "Well, I saw this weird thing, before mum disappeared, she was crying
      in her garden, there was this weird man in there with her, he had really long
      arms. When mum saw me she ran over, and hugged me tight. She told me to close
      my eyes but I didn\u2019t. It had these really big glowing eyes, they were
      so bright, they looked like the sun. I saw mum with it, a few days ago again.
      I remember she smiled at me but then she was just gone. I ran down the hall
      as fast as I could but she wasn\u2019t there."
