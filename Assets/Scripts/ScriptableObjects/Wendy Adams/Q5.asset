  TheQuestion: Can you tell me about Annie Adams?
  TheAnswer: "She\u2019s my mum, she\u2019s a gardener. She used to tell me I\u2019m
    her little seed, and one day she would put me in the ground and I would sprout,
    just like she did, I don\u2019t really get what she means though. Have you found
    her yet? I miss her lots and lots."
