  TheQuestion: Can you tell me about Cassie Hack?
  TheAnswer: "She looks really scary, and says mean things, but she\u2019s actually
    nice. She gives me candy sometimes, and calls me a little troll. She and Mum
    used to drink tea in Mum's garden, but Mum never let me join when they were doing
    that. "

  - TheQuestion: Why did your mum not let you drink tea with them?
    TheAnswer: "She said it was a grown-up girls tea party, and that I could join
      when I was older. But I saw Uncle Stuart going in there while they were doing
      it, so it\u2019s not fair, he\u2019s a grownup but he's not a girl!"
