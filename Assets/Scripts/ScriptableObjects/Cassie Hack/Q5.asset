  TheQuestion: Can you tell me about Annie Adams?
  TheAnswer: "She had this amazing garden, these huge flowers that looked like you
    could fall into them. She invited me often, offered me a lot of tea, it was calming,
    and nice\u2026 but\u2026 It always had this strange aftertaste\u2026 I still
    can\u2019t get it out of my head. She was always talking about Stewart too\u2026
    I think she liked him, or wanted me to like him, not sure which. "
