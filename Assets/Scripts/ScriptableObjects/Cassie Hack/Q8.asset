  TheQuestion: Have you seen anything strange in the building?
  TheAnswer: "I\u2026 I don\u2019t believe in ghosts and the like but I also believe
    that there are things in the world we can\u2019t explain. If I tell you, I promise
    you won\u2019t think I\u2019m nuts, or that I had anything to do with all this
    crazy shit happening."

  - TheQuestion: " I\u2019m just here to figure out what happened, if you have any
      information please share it. "
    TheAnswer: "A few days ago, shortly after Annie disappeared. I saw something\u2026
      I\u2019m not sure what, but it had these long\u2026 Arms, I think. They just
      looked wrong. Its eyes glew so bright I thought I would go blind. I\u2019m
      not sure what it was, or what it wanted\u2026 but it looked at me, and I still
      do sometimes. "
