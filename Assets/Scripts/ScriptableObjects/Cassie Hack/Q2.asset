  TheQuestion: Can you tell me about James Adams?
  TheAnswer: "Annie\u2019s husband, they all live in 302 together, don\u2019t know
    much else about him. He usually stinks of booze. Annie knew he was laid off,
    and I\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t leave sooner. Maybe that\u2019s what all
    those late night conversations with Stuart were about."

  - TheQuestion: Why are you so convinced Annie left voluntarily?
    TheAnswer: "Well\u2026 She often complained during our tea times, she was always
      talking about how things are going to get better, that she was gonna go somewhere
      new. I assumed it was somewhere tropical but she never wanted to tell me where
      she was going, and to be honest, I can\u2019t really see her leaving Wendy
      behind, she talked about bringing her."
