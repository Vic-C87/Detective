  TheQuestion: Have you seen anything strange in the building?
  TheAnswer: "Now that you mention it detective, a few days ago I heard Annie and
    Mr Hartwell speaking about the beach. I couldn\u2019t make out all of it through
    the door but I could tell she was trying to convince him of something. But to
    be honest I mostly stay in my room, with Diana as company."

  - TheQuestion: Who is Diana?
    TheAnswer: "Well my pomeranian of course! Named after princess Diana of course.
      I can tell she\u2019s going to be a wonderful queen. She\u2019s usually very
      calm but she\u2019s been more agitated lately, always barking, especially around
      that Miss Hack."
