  TheQuestion: Can you tell me about Annie Adams?
  TheAnswer: "Not much to say\u2026 she was a rude woman, I invited her to tea once
    and she told me she doesn\u2019t drink the kind of dishwater I serve\u2026 I
    asked her what she drinks and she said that I couldn\u2019t handle it. But I
    was welcome to come to her garden and see. I never ended up going though, couldn\u2019t
    find a sitter for Diana."
