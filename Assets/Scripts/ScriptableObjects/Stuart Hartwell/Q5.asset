  TheQuestion: Can you tell me about Annie Adams?
  TheAnswer: "She\u2019s wonderful, a true venus, not to mention a great conversationalist
    and she makes a lovely cup of tea. I met her a few years ago, while researching
    the mariana trench. After the building was finished, she wrote to me and told
    me I should move here. So I did. You should really take a look at her garden,
    she loves her garden. "
