  - TheQuestion: "What\u2019s wrong with The Landlord? "
    TheAnswer: "Well he keeps going after things that aren\u2019t his. He\u2019s
      like a child trying to steal someone else's toy, or sees two people playing
      a game he wasn\u2019t invited to and tries to butt in. It\u2019s not his place."
