  - TheQuestion: 'What are you talking about? '
    TheAnswer: "I suppose it\u2019s easier if I explain, have you heard of Scotomization
      detective? It\u2019s the idea that some people, unable to comprehend certain
      realities, will mentally block them out. But what if you take that concept,
      and display it on a grander level, what if humans, unable to comprehend or
      mentally manage a certain facet of reality, block it out? I mean everyone,
      even you. "

  - TheQuestion: "What is it I\u2019m not seeing? "
    TheAnswer: "Well fuck, everything, don\u2019t you understand? If every person
      alive blocks out an entire facet of reality, what happens when someone CAN
      see it? What happens, when she-, someone, can see something the rest of us
      can\u2019t comprehend? Is it Moses meeting God on the mountain? Does it make
      that person become unable to be comprehended by the rest of us?"

    TheAnswer: "You\u2019re no fun are you? If I tell you all the answers, you have
      nothing to figure out do you? I\u2019ll tell you one thing detective, Annie
      opened her eyes, and saw the world for what it was, and she wasn\u2019t the
      only one who tried."
