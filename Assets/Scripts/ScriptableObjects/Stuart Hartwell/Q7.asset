  TheQuestion: What do you do for work?
  TheAnswer: "I used to be a researcher, now I\u2019m a professor. I work down at
    the university, it\u2019s on the beachfront. Speaking of, have you ever seen
    a beached whale? It\u2019s part of my work, I teach marine biology. "

  - TheQuestion: 'Why are you asking me about beached whales? '
    TheAnswer: "Well I find it fascinating, and to be honest with you detective,
      I feel like that sometimes. Not like the whale, but like an onlooker. Seeing
      something strange and out of place somewhere it doesn\u2019t belong. Paralyzed,
      even, not knowing whether to act and help, or watch on. Seeing a  goliath,
      which in normal circumstances would ignore me, but for this moment, helpless
      without my intervention. "
