  TheQuestion: Can you tell me about James Adams?
  TheAnswer: "He\u2019s lucky, I\u2019ll tell you that for free. I could say a lot
    more about the man and his antics, but I will speak ill of no man, and speak
    all the good I know of everybody."

  - TheQuestion: This is a police investigation, if you have any pertinent information,
      share it.
    TheAnswer: "Fine, if I must. He\u2019s a bum, and if it wasn\u2019t for Annie,
      he would be on the street a long time ago. I don\u2019t get why she kept him
      around for as long as she did, especially since he was lying to her about having
      a job. If you\u2019re curious how I know, things move down the vine quickly
      around here. "
